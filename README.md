This project implements a vehicle detection and tracking system using YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) deep learning model. The system can:
Detect vehicles in video streams using YOLOv8
Track vehicles across frames
Count vehicles as they enter a predefined detection zone
Visualize detections and tracking information in real-time

Features
 Vehicle detection using pre-trained YOLOv8 models
Video processing for both live streams and recorded videos
Object tracking to maintain vehicle IDs across frames
Counting mechanism for vehicles entering a specified zone
Visualization of detection boxes, tracking IDs, and counts
Optimized for performance with adjustable parameters
