Vehicle Detection & Tracking (YOLOv8)

This project implements a **real-time vehicle detection and tracking system** using the **YOLOv8 deep learning model**. It works with both **live webcam feeds** and **recorded video files**, enabling vehicle detection, tracking, and counting with visualization overlays.

Features

* Real-Time Vehicle Detection → Detects multiple vehicle classes using YOLOv8.
* Object Tracking→ Assigns unique IDs to vehicles across frames.
* Vehicle Counting → Counts vehicles crossing a predefined zone.
* Video Source Support → Works with **webcams (live)** and **MP4/AVI videos**.
* Optimized Performance → Adjustable detection confidence & tracking parameters.
* Live Visualization → Bounding boxes, tracking IDs, and counts displayed in real time.

Tech Stack

* Model: YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
* Frameworks/Libraries: Python, OpenCV, NumPy, Ultralytics YOLO
* Input Sources: Webcam, Video files

---
Example Output

* Bounding boxes with vehicle labels
* Unique IDs per vehicle
* Vehicle counts in detection zone

*(Add a GIF/screenshot here for recruiters to see results easily)*

---

Future Improvements

* Multiple zone counting
* Speed estimation of vehicles
* Export logs (CSV/Excel) for analytics

Do you want me to also **make a short README template** for your *Smart Vision Analytics project* separately, so the two repos don’t overlap?
